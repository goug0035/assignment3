        <p>The Kilcormac story begins in the spring of 1978 when three friends were on a trip through Ireland's heartland. Greg Taylor, Cam Heaps and Greg Cromwell had all been colleagues at one of Irlands premier microbreweries producing quality beer in the late 1960's and 70's - before it was bought out by a national brewer and closed down. As they sat around a campfire, the self-named "Three Fired Guys" dreamed and desiced to run their own brewery with that name.</p>
        
        <p>The Three Fired Guys Brewery was so beloved locally, a special batch was brewed as a Christmas gift for our loyal patrons. That special batch was the first official time they changes the name to Kilcormac. Kilcormac, the town in which they lives, pays homage to their origan and patrons. So next time you see a bottle of Kilcormac, take note of the history paired with the rich flavour on and in every bottle.</p>
